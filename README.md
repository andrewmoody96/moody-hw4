## JS Quiz

https://andrewmoody96.github.io/moody-hw4/

## Description
This app is going to provide users a 5 question quiz on the basics of JavaScript. After the quiz has been completed, users will be able to save their score and initials. Each time a quiz is finished, the score will be added to a list of existing scores and displayed on a high scores page.

### Issues
This app is probably less than half built at this point in time. I keep finding roadblocks that are slowing me down. I tried to revisit the classes on JavaScript to point me in the right direction. While they helped, unfortunately it wasn't quite enough for me to connect the dots. I have reached out for help from a tutor with full intent to resubmit this. I've attached a link to the GitHub pages site so you can see what's available so far. At this point, I am unable to get just a single question's answers displayed.

I spent my time trying to get this to work before I spent any on responsive design or styling. Since I couldn't get it to work, I have not moved past the functionality. I intend to meet all of these requirements as well after resubmitting.
